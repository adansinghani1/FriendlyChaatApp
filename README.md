# Firebase Codelab: FriendlyChat

[![Actions Status][gh-actions-badge]][gh-actions]

This is the source code for the Firebase FriendlyChat codelabs. To get started open the codelab instructions:

 - [Build FriendlyChat Codelab](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-android/)




## Instructions to Start the App:
Download or clone the repository locally onto your hardrive
Build the project
After it is build, type this command into your terminal "firebase emulators:start --project=demo-friendlychat" (you will be able to see realtime database)
Once cloned, you should be able to press the play button or go on the "Run" tab on the tool bar and press run 'build-android-start.app'
** make sure your gradle is 6.7.1 or change it in the gradle-wrapper.properties to 6.7.1. I had to move the gradle-wrapper-properties file outside in the main FriendlyChat folder. **


## What is updated?
Everything is runnable (you can check). I even provided a demo of how it worked. Thank you for your patience for the assignment. I have been trying my best to keep up.
